## About authenticity, The Journey Begins & Ending the Reign of Evil

As you can see, The Journey begins comes in four different files. Why?

If you're looking for absolute 8-bit realism in your game, you might know there were only 
four channels dedicated to audio back in the day (plus the samples channel, but we don't talk about the samples channel...). 

The noise channel is typically used for SFX/SE (sound effects), but it could also be used to emulate drums. 
So, depending on where you want to use The Journey Begins, perhaps you don't mind having the drums play. 
Perhaps you do. That's why I included both versions. 

Similar to Ending the Reign of Evil, The Journey Begins also has a short intro, not to be included in the main loop. 
Hence the multiple files for these two tracks!
